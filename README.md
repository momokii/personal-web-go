# Personal Website with Go

This repository contains the source code for my personal website. It is built using HTML, CSS, and served using the Go Fiber web framework. The site showcases my profile, portfolio, and other relevant information.  

Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or use it as inspiration for your own project!  

**Features:**  
- Simple and responsive design with HTML and CSS

**How to Run:**  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Install Go and run the server using:  
   ```bash

3. Access the website **at** `http://localhost:3002` (or the specified port for app/web).
4. Access the prometheus exporter **at** `http://localhost:3002` (or the specified port for exporte).
