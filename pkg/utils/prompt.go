### Projects
- **Fruitarians**: GCP‑deployed mobile marketplace with ML‑driven freshness detection.  
- **Equisafe**: Disaster‑literacy app APIs for special‑needs children (Node.js, MongoDB, GCP).  

- **Echo Notes**: Innovative web application that redefines meeting management. This solution seamlessly records live meetings with crystal-clear audio, leveraging LLM-based speech-to-text technology (Whisper) for precise transcription. It then utilizes advanced GPT-series models to generate intelligent, concise summaries—ensuring that every key insight is captured effortlessly.
Built with a robust backend powered by Golang Fiber, the application delivers exceptional performance and scalability. The user experience is streamlined with a simple yet effective front-end, crafted using jQuery, HTML, and Bootstrap, while Postgresql underpins the data management, ensuring reliability and data integrity.

The project is built with Golang Fiber for the backend and uses a simple front-end design powered by HTML, Bootstrap, and jQuery. It employs a centralized session management system stored in PostgreSQL as the source of truth for user sessions, while each application maintains its own local session as needed.

- **GoChat**: GoChat is a personal project built to explore WebSocket implementation. It’s a simple chat website featuring user authentication with personalization, the ability to create and customize chat rooms, and support for public and private room concepts.
The application is developed using Golang with the Fiber framework, PostgreSQL as the database, and a straightforward interface utilizing HTML, Bootstrap, and jQuery.

- **Gabut Project**: Curious and eager to explore, I experimented with using Large Language Models (LLMs) in different areas like text-based interactions, image generation, vision, and text-to-speech. Using providers like OpenAI and Anthropic, I built a website showcasing several sub-projects that apply LLMs in practical ways:
-- Medium Account Roast
-- Website Roast/Analysis
-- Butterfly Effect Stories Generator
-- Creative Content Generator
Repo: github.com/momokii/web-try-claude-go

### Awards
- [Gold Medal at Indonesia International Applied Science Project Olympiad (I2ASPO) 2023] 
Gold Medal, I2ASPO (2023)] The Indonesia International Applied Science Project Olympiad is a competition that brings together young researchers from around the world to showcase their creativity at an international standard. Despite the rigorous competition, our team remained determined and successfully achieved remarkable results.
As part of this event, My team develop a mobile application project, Equisafe: an innovative platform designed to enhance natural disaster literacy for children with disabilities. The app features engaging video animations, games, and sign language translation capabilities. My role involved designing, developing, and documenting APIs using Node.js (Express) and MongoDB, integrating Google Cloud Platform for object storage, and deploying the APIs through App Engine.   

- [Incentive for Student Creativity Program of Scientific Articles (PKM-AI)] 
Student Creativity Week (PKM) is a program organized by the Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education (Kemenristekdikti) to facilitate and support innovative ideas from students across Indonesia. With 11 categories available, we participated in the PKM-AI category. Among numerous submissions from universities nationwide, our research idea earned funding support from Kemenristekdikti.

(The Impact of Adaptive and Non-Adaptive Learning Rates on MLP, 1D-CNN, and Ensemble Methods for Diamond Price Prediction) exploring the impacts of learning rate strategies on model accuracy and performance.  

- [Top 7 Finalist Business Challenge at ASTRANAUTS 2024] 
Out of over 2,000 registrants and 1,000 submitted proposals, our team successfully advanced to the top 19 Astranauts finalists and eventually secured a spot as one of the top 7 business challenge finalists. As a result, we (AGAK LAEN Team) were invited by the Astranauts team to present our proposal in the final round. We proposed an innovative solution in the form of a comprehensive mobile application designed to monitor coal inventory across multiple storage locations within the company.
The application focuses on providing real-time data visualization of coal shipments, stock levels, and quality, enabling efficient inventory management and informed decision-making. As part of the project, I contributed to designing the mobile app prototype and developing the system schema to address challenges related to real-time coal quality calculations.
